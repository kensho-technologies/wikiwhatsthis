WikiWhatsThis is an R&D project at Kensho focused on fighting misinformation by grounding online stories with Wikipedia content. The goal is to create a browser extension that will allow readers to highlight arbitrary text and receive suggestions on relevenat Wikipedia articles.   

# Status
**WikiWhatsThis is a work in progress and not polished production code**. We are experimenting with Wikimedia data, [explicit topic modeling](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shaulm/papers/pdf/Egozi-Gabrilovich-Markovitch-TOIS2011.pdf), and running the Python scientific stack in a browser via [pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide). 

# Outside Funding 
During the summer of 2020 we had the pleasure of hiring Minhvy Van to help us on the project. Her stipend was paid using a [WikiCred grant](https://misinfocon.com/introducing-the-second-round-of-wikicred-grantees-6aa788dc0850).
